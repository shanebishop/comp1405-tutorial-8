Programs I wrote for tutorial 8 of my Introduction to Computer Science I course

The rectangular list program checks to see if a list is rectangular (each sublist is of the same length).

The numeric values program checks to see if a list is composed of numeric values only.

The matrix program reuses the code from the first two exercises to determine if a list is both rectangular and numeric, and therefore a matrix.

The matrix print program prints a matrix with some formatting.

The zero matrix program generates a zero matrix of arbitrary dimensions.

The identity matrix program identity matrix of arbitrary dimensions.

The matrix dimensions program checks to see if any two matrices have the same number of rows and columns.
